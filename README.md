# Webapp_Securing_Project

This is still under construction as I learn the different methods a webapp can be deployed.

Once I get more comfortable deploying, I will begin security hardening of all facets of the project along with some penetration testing to simulate attacks. This project is ongoing, with continuous updates to track improvements in security controls over time.
