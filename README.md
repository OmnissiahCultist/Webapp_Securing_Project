# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

# [ Initial Hopes and Dreams ]

This is still under construction as I learn the different methods a webapp can be deployed, I plan on documenting the journey of securing it!

   Once I get more comfortable deploying, I will begin security hardening of all facets of the project along with some penetration testing to simulate attacks. This project is ongoing, with continuous updates to track improvements in security controls over time. Ideally I set up a database that can store user login information, possibly more, anything to get a foundation of authenticated users. I aim to keep a chronological log of milestones/security controls implemented to identify where an unsecure software has gone from baseline, to it's current more secure state.
